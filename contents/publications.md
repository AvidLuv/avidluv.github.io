        <div style="flex: 1;">
            As a programmer in the line-following robot project at the University of Manchester, I was responsible for reading data from light and speed sensors using C language, processing the sensor data, and implementing a PID algorithm to enable the robot to follow a pre-set white line both swiftly and stably. The entire system was developed on an STM32F401RE microcontroller, and our team secured second place in the final competition.

        <div style="flex: 1;">
            An independent development of a dynamic gesture recognition system for an embedded system was achieved. The system utilizes the Mediapipe hand keypoints model to extract keypoints from a live video stream. Angle features between keypoint vectors are calculated and stacked to form a time series of gesture features. Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW) is then applied to measure the similarity between the live gesture's feature time series and the dataset, enabling accurate gesture recognition.
